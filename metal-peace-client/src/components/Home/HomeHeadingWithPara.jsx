          Before I started my own practice, I worked in regular healthcare for
          15 years at higher professional level. Including within addiction care
          and mental health care, both with children and adults. It has given me
          a lot of insight into us humans and has increased my fascination and
          admiration for humanity. With this wealth of experience I came into
          contact with Mental Peace. A world opened up for me when I made
          contact with my subconscious in sessions. And discovered that I could
          guide people on a deeper level with energetic sessions.
          <br /> <br />
          The sessions enabled people to actually get their pain out of their
          system, instead of learning to live with it. After years of sessions
          with myself and others, I felt in 2012 that it was time to set up my
          own practice. In my work I combine the knowledge and experience of
          regular care with Mental Peace. In addition to the sessions, I am an
          author for the online magazines Nieuwetijdskind and Inspirerend Leven.
          I write about the origins of blockages, your intuition, how to deal
          with feelings and more.
