        I have now discovered that life is about self-knowledge, discovering
        your possibilities. Getting to know yourself, acting accordingly,
        growing. Not only in your own interest, but in the interest of all
        people. After all, everything is connected. I am also still developing,
        but I now understand more about life.
        <br />

        That is what makes gnosis so interesting to me. You go on a journey of
        discovery and gain insights yourself. You cannot learn this from a book
        or by thinking, you have to experience it. Before I started my practice,
        I worked in regular healthcare for 15 years. With mentally/physically
        disabled children, in adult psychiatry, youth psychiatry, a TBS clinic
        and an asylum seeker center.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the last 10 years I have worked as a prevention worker in addiction
        care. I had contact with young people, professionals and parents. In
        addition to providing information and training, I worked with children
        of parents with addiction and/or psychological problems. The common
        thread throughout all these years was the suffering of many people. And
        that the efforts of the professionals could often only partially
        alleviate the suffering. My own experiences with gnosis prompt me to
        guide others on this path. By understanding how your complaints arose
        and removing them from your energetic system, life takes on color again.
        <br />
        <br />
        Discovering your own strength and possibilities is the key to a better
        life. After years of working with methodologies and protocols in care, I
        now work from my intuition. Every person is different, people do not fit
        into one pattern. You do not have to plan the route in advance, that is
        done along the way. The wisdom of your own energetic system and the
        universe is infinite. This leaves room to discover what comes your way.
        That is much more beautiful than your mind could ever imagine. That
        makes it special for me to do this work!
